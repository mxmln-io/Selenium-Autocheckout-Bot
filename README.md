Selenium Checkout Automation Project

This project is a Python script that automates the checkout process of an e-commerce website using the Selenium library. The script is designed to purchase a specific item from the website and complete the entire checkout process without any human intervention.

Installation

To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
Selenium library for Python
To install the Selenium library, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Open a command prompt or terminal window and type:

Copy code
pip install selenium
Usage

To use the script, you will need to modify the variables at the top of the checkout.py file to match your specific e-commerce website and item details.

The script will launch a new instance of a web browser (currently set to Chrome) and navigate to the specified website. It will then automatically log in using the provided credentials and search for the specified item. Once the item is found, the script will select the desired color and size, add it to the cart, and proceed to the checkout page. Finally, the script will fill out the checkout form with the provided shipping and payment information and complete the purchase.
